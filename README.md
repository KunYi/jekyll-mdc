# Matrial Components Web + Jekyll + Travis-CI for GitHub Pages
---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KunYi/jekyll-mdc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KunYi/jekyll-mdc)

To use: when you have the dependancies as per
[the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) you should run
`bundle install`.
    
HTML files are based on Minima - if you need to configure
the post or page layouts, copy [those files](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts) in as needed.

Note that GitHub Pages doesn't run gems that aren't on their predefined list, so it won't work with their autocompile, you'll need to push up and serve the compiled files.
